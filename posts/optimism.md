# Optimism
## Personal experience
Before starting to write about my opinion of the optimism, i would start
talking about my personal experience around this topic. 
Recently while thinking about the changes of my life around the time I started 
noticing that my recent thoughs were charged with a lot of pessimism compared
to the thoughs that i had when i was younger, so guided by Ango's post I wanted
to find the things that have changed in my context. For example I found that I 
have finished my school but what i had planned didn't come true, so for that
time I was very unmotivated and whishing that the school time come over very fast, 
since then I change the time distance for my plans and thinking more about 
auxiliary plans.

## All people act the same?
I think that growing up implies to met a lot of new people (different context,
cultures, habits or ideologies)and how we could filter the persons that could 
mix with our personalities or if his/her intentions could benefict us. It's very
complex since i know anyone could read the mind so we need to test the person and
as the time pass we start developing a trust in each other but even a long 
friendship could end bad or someone could make a mistake and sent the relation 
to the forgiveness. So, is better to start the relation as a withe board?
I think (us) the _Homo Sapiens_ are selfish so we always will priorize our
benefict if and only if we will not win something, so wait to a person to do 
something just for the friendship could be a dream (in some cases could be 
possible, who knows?)

## The point of view
I want to change your point of view around the pessimism because i dont wait
to the things could go bad, i knew it and it's a surprise if it go better than 
you expected, just imagine to start a shop and wait to became the top sellers 
in one week, where the process is? you need to make the things you want even if
the things could go bad, and not just for the reward, enjoy the process enjoy
the bad grades enjoy the lessons, if the reward is the motivation to make
something you mustn't start making that

## Conclussion
I know that having a pessimism point of view could be a lot more easy that being
optimism but being pessimist could prepare you mentally to overcome bad times 
(because they exists). Not always you will win so start making your reward the 
time you spent making something, enjoy the adversities, choose the things that 
will help you to grow and dont wait for a reward to make something.
