# Optimism
## Personal experience
Before sharing my opinion on optimism, I want to start by discussing my personal experience with this topic. Recently, while reflecting on the changes in my life, I noticed that my recent thoughts were much more pessimistic compared to those I had when I was younger. Inspired by Ango's post, I wanted to identify what had changed in my context. For example, I found that although I had finished school, my plans didn't come to fruition. During that time, I felt very unmotivated and wished for the school years to end quickly. Since then, I have adjusted the timelines for my plans and started considering more backup plans.

## All people act the same?
I believe that growing up involves meeting many new people from different backgrounds, cultures, habits, and ideologies. We need to determine who fits with our personalities and who has intentions that might benefit us. This process is complex since we can't read minds. We need to test people over time, gradually developing trust. However, even long-term friendships can end badly or suffer from mistakes that require forgiveness. So, should we start relationships as blank slates? I think (we) _homo sapiens_ are inherently selfish, prioritizing our own benefits unless there's nothing to gain. Expecting someone to do something purely for friendship can be unrealistic (though it can happen in some cases).

## The point of view
I want to change your perspective on pessimism. It's not about expecting things to go wrong; it's about being pleasantly surprised when they go better than expected. Imagine starting a business and expecting to become top sellers in one weekâ€”where's the process in that? You need to pursue your goals even if things might go wrong. Don't just focus on the reward; enjoy the process, the failures, and the lessons learned. If the reward is your only motivation, you shouldn't start in the first place.

## Conclussion
I know that having a pessimistic point of view can be easier than being optimistic. However, being a pessimist can mentally prepare you to overcome tough times (because they do exist). You won't always win, so make the time spent on something your reward. Enjoy the adversities, choose things that help you grow, and don't wait for a reward to motivate you.
