# Gamification
One day surfing in google, I found a personal/proffesional blog made by [Austin Z. Henley](https://austinhenley.com/blog/gamification.html) and i decide to read more about the posts, his achievements and proffesional career; the first impression was about the style a really minimal but beautiful web page, later the published posts took my attention but there was an entry that talk about the life gamification so i decide to read it, this post is about my experience with the post topic
## Introduction

I’m a disorganized person, but in recent years, I have been searching for a method to help me overcome this. During my search, I discovered the gamification method, which involves turning life goals into game-like tasks. This method includes measuring the time spent on tasks, the attempts made, and eventually earning an imaginary medal that symbolizes achieving the goal. After understanding this method, I decided to implement it in my life. However, just like with video games, I struggled. I could never achieve my goals, often getting distracted after the third day (or even on the first day if something special happened). Despite using various apps, habit trackers, and even promising myself rewards like candy, I couldn't stick to it. Eventually, I got tired of trying and started searching for other methods.

## Development

As Austin discusses in his post, real life doesn’t have progress bars or streaks to guide personal or professional improvement. Keeping track on your own can be demotivating (even though there are apps and websites that do this for you). These apps try to bring medals, badges, or titles into real life. However, (we the) _homo sapiens_ are social animals and constantly compare ourselves with others. This can lead to toxic competitiveness if we don’t change our mindset. There are two potential outcomes: either we hurt ourselves by regretting what we did or didn't do, or we hurt others by envying those who have what we desire or by discrediting their achievements. But does this happen in every case?

## Solution?

I don't want to generalize, as I have met some people who manage these feelings well and use them as motivation to improve as a group (e.g., betting on who will get the better grade). Achieving this requires personal development and the luck to find a supportive group (I can't prove it, but I think a minimum level of friendship is necessary). Some apps that use this method for teaching (like Duolingo) offer the option to congratulate and motivate friends based on their streaks. Personally, I didn't have any friends on Duolingo whom I knew in real life, so this didn’t motivate me much. In other areas of my life, I noticed that apps like GitHub also use this method. When I discovered the code streak feature, which measures the amount of code and the days it was published, I decided to extend my streak daily. However, over time, I found myself forcing out code just to maintain the streak. Some of the repositories that appear on my streak dashboard today don't even exist, so it’s just a lie to make me feel productive, but it doesn’t provide any real reward.

## Conclusion

In my experience, applying this method to my life only works if I don’t overthink what I’m doing. I’m not trying to discourage anyone from using it; I’m just saying it doesn’t work for me. My conclusion is that forcing ourselves to complete tasks isn’t helpful. It’s better to do something because we genuinely want to achieve it and find it enjoyable, without needing an elaborate background just make it if you think is funny.
