_One day surfing in google, I found a personal/proffesional blog made by [Austin Z. Henley](https://austinhenley.com/blog/gamification.html) and i decide to read more about the posts, his achievements and proffesional career; the first impression was about the style a really minimal but beautiful web page, later the published posts took my attention but there was an entry that talk about the life gamification so i decide to read it, this post is about my experience with the post topic_

## Gamification
### Intro
I'm a disorganized person but in the last years I was trying to find a method that could help me solving this, on my search i found the gamification method that is based on make your try to make your life goals as a game task measuring the time spent on it, the tries and finally gaetting an imaginary medal that says to everyone that ypu finally achive the goal. After undersatnding this method I was decided to implement it into my life, but like the video games I was a disaster, i never could achive the goal always after the third day (and if something special never happend on the first day) I get distracted. So after a lot of tries using apps, measuring the goals with an habit tracker or easily saying that i would get a candy if i do that until the finish of the week I got tired of trying and start searching for other methods

### Development
As Austin discuss on his post the real life doesn't have progress bars or streaks to guide yourself in your personal/professional improvement so taking the count by your own could be a demotiving task (i know there exist apps and pages to do this for you) but this is my next point this apps try to take medals, badges or tittles into the real life, but i think that we the  _homo sapiens_ are  a social animal that are continuously comparing our selfs with our partners but as the games we start to compete but here is the difference between real life and video games (but in some cases the video games have it), we start to develop a toxic competitiveness that could take to paths if we don't change our minds, the first is to start hurting our selfs like regreting of doing or not doing something and the second is to start to hurt the others the person who has a the house of my dreams or discrediting the achievements of the others. But here is the question This occur in all the cases?

### Solution?
I don't want to get into a generlization so i have to say that I have met some persons that manage this feelings and uses them as a motivation to be better in group (for example betting about who is going to have the better grade), but to do this it requires a lot of personal developing and having the luck to find a group to do that (i can't proof this but i think it requires a minimun level of friendship). In other cases i saw that some apps that use this method to teach (Duolingo for example) have the option to congratulate and motivate the app friends by the streak goals, personally i didn't have any friend in duolingo that i have met in the real life so this didn't motivate my self to much.
In other fields in my life that i noticed apps (that i use) uses this method is github, when i discover the code streak that measure the amount of code and the days where are published I took the choice to make the streak bigger every day, but with the pass of the days i started noticing that was forcing my self to make crazy code, just to don't loose the streak, some of the repos that appear to be code on my streak dashboard today don't even exists so it is just a lie to me, to make me feel better, to make me feel that i'm productive but this don't give me a reward.
 
### Conclussion
So in my experience applying this method on my life only works if i don't think to much about what i'm doing, I never try to demotivate you of using this I'm just saying that this doesn't work for me. So i want to conclude saying that is not helpful to make something forcing our selfs to finish the task, it's better to do if i have the desire to accomplish it and it doesn't need to have a far-fetched background just make it because you think is funny.
